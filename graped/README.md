# Graped

Grape**d** is the **d**aemon that runs on the Master RPi and that manages the Grape stacks. It is capable of detecting the connected Grape stacks, reading the sensors if they are available (temperature and power) and power up and down the Worker RPi through the power switches.

# How to use

The daemon is normally automatically installed as a service on the Master RPi via the `.sh` scripts located in the folder `master_setup` of this repository.
